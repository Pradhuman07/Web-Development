<!-- What Are HTML Entities?
HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Why Use HTML Entities?
Here are some reasons:
1.Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
2.Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
3.Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line. 

Common HTML Entities:-
&lt;  for <
&gt;  for >
&amp; for &
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&copy; for ©-->
