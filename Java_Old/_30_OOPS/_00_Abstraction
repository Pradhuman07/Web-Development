                                    ==>ABSTRACTION

-Abstraction is the process in which "we only show essential details/functionality to the user".
The "non essential implementation details are not displayed to the user". [Eg:- ATM Machine]

-Data Abstraction may also be define as "The process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object,ignoring the irrelevent details".

-In JAVA, Abstraction is achieved by:-
    i)Interfaces (We can achieve 100% abstraction using Interfaces)
    ii)Abstract Classes

-The properties and the behaviours of the object differentiate it from other objects of similar types(similar type mtlb jiski class same ho)and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.
[array ki mdt se grouping kr skte similar datatype ki aur unki ikkathi properties change krskte h]



                         ==> ABSTRACT CLASSES AND ABSRACT METHODS

-An Abstract class is a class that is declared with an Abstract keyword.   Eg:Abstract class joy{  }

-An Abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation(kuch krte nhi h).

-An Abstract class may or may not have all Abstract methods. 
 Some of them can be concrete methods(jo poora h remember Abstract mtlb adhoora)

-Any class that contains one or more Abstract methods must also be declare with an Abstract keyword.

-There can be no object of an Abstract class, i.e , an Abstract Class can not be directly instantiated with the 'new keyword'.

-An Abstract class can have parametrized constructor and the default constructo is always present in an Abstract class

-A method define Abstract must always be redefine in the subclass (subclass bnana is compulsory).
