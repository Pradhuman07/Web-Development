Class:-It is a blueprint,where objects are created.
Object:-It is an instance of a Class,having certain States and Behaviours.

Object is a real world entity (It 'has' "States" , It 'does' "Behaviours" )
States => Variables [height,wt]
Behaviours => Methods [walk,bark]      *Note:-Min 2 methods should be there.

Q.How many objects we can create from a single Class
Ans. Any no. of objects 

We can create object from Class....but can't create Class from object

Note:-Naming class is done by "Pascal Case" Eg:- AnimalKingdom
for naming Variables :- "Camel Case" is used Eg:- whiteDog

Ways to create Object :-
                        instance()
                        new keyword
                        Object clone
                        Factory design

#Syntax for creating class:-
                            public class ClassName{

                            }

#Syntax for creating object:-
                              ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName();
                              ClassName ObjectName = new Constructor;

#Eg:-
        public class Animal{
            void eat(){
                sout(")
            }
            Animal Dog = new Animal();
        }

Q.How many public class can be present in a program
Ans. Only One that too in which main method is present

Dot is a operator which provides us access of the 

3 Types of Variables:-

1.Local Variables  :- present inside any method  [Must be initialized]
2.Instance variable:- Class ke andr but method se baahr [aka.Class Variables ]
3.Static Variable  :-
