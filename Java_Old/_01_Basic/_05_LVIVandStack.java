//same variable name but no error bcoz "Every method has its own stack(memory separation in RAM)".
//Moreover a and b are "local variable" (which are declared within the body of a method)

//a and b are local variables of method 1 and as well as of main method....since within the body of a method
//if you declare a and b b/w line 5 and 6 , then they will be called as global variable ...since declare outsside the function but to access them you will need to create an object and call them non-statistically bcoz they will be the instance variable and they will be in heap memory
