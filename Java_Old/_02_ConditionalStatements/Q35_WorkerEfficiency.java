//Q35. In a company, worker efficiency is determined on the basis of the time required for a
// worker to complete a particular job. If the time taken by the worker is between 2 – 3
// hours, then the worker is said to be highly efficient. If the time required by the worker is
// between 3 – 4 hours, then the worker is ordered to improve speed. If the time taken is
// between 4 – 5 hours, the worker is given training to improve his speed, and if the time
// taken by the worker is more than 5 hours, then the worker has to leave the company. If the
// time taken by the worker is input through the keyboard, find the efficiency of the worker.
