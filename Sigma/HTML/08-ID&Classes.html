<!-- 
    1.An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.

    2.The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior *all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements. 

    3.(Every element has unique id and) one element can have only one id
      (Every element can have same class and) one element can have multiple classes[multiple classes are separated by space like in Second div]. 

    4.In CSS,
    Elements with IDs are selected using a hash (#) symbol before the ID, 
    and elements with classes are selected using a dot (.) before the class name.
